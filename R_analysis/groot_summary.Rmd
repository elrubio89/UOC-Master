### 1. get: 
**groot get -d card**   
_generates a folder called card.90 with clustered database at 90% identity (only option) in msa (Multiple sequence alignment) files (each cluster is an msa file)_  
msa structure: (clusterXXX.msa)  
\>Reference sequence  
\>Consensus  
  
Card: 1176 clusters  

### 2. index:
_Convert a set of clustered reference sequences to variation graphs and then index them_

#### 2.1 Create variaton graphs
The MSA is converted to a variation graph by first using the representative sequence (consensus) as the graph backbone; each base of the sequence is a node with edges connecting them in series. 

Graph traversal: a path among a variation graph. 

#### 2.2 Fingerprint graph traversals

1. A sliding window of length _w_ (lenght of query reads) is moved across all graph traversals.  
2. A MinHash signature is created for each window.
